# Pimp My Twitter Header
### (with github actions)

Shows your latest followers on your banner and a followers progress bar in your location section.

Likely leads to increased engagement so if you're some social media freak you'll probably want to use this.

Forked from guillaume-rygn.
It basically does the same thing as his original project except you don't have do bother with hosting.

Simply Fork, go in Settings, Secrets and variables, Actions, and add the following secrets:

ACCESS_TOKEN (This is your access token)
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET (This is your access token secret)
API_KEY (This is your API key)
API_KEY_SECRET (This is your API key secret)
HANDLE (For this one put your twitter handle without the @)

Make sure your dev twitter account has an elevated level and your app has read, write and direct message permissions.
